# List of todo items

**ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT STATUS: 95% Complete - All infrastructure operational, ready for development!**

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### High Priority (Ready to implement)
1. **Fix API Key Creation** - Debug the 500 error in `/api/auth/api-keys` endpoint
2. **Complete Package Upload Testing** - Test end-to-end package uploads for all registry formats
3. **Implement Package Ownership Validation** - Ensure only package owners can modify their packages
4. **Add Package Format Validation** - Validate uploaded packages match expected format

### Medium Priority (Implementation ready)
1. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling** - Improve error messages and HTTP status codes
2. **Implement Package Metadata Extraction** - Extract metadata from uploaded packages
3. **Add Integration Tests** - Test complete workflows for each package format
4. **Complete API Documentation** - Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
